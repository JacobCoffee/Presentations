The actual files in this repository are just the presentation that Alex put together to explain Git and Github to the group, which serves as a nice little primer on why Git is useful and why Github makes it so much better.  If you're just starting with Git, read that first before jumping into the setup!


This presentation goes hand-in-hand with the [learn-git repository](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/learn-git) that is also part of the CSC projects.  There, you can find more information about the project and what it provides.  You can check out the Readme file [here](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/learn-git/blob/master/README.md).


The presentation was created using [DeckSet](http://www.decksetapp.com), which compiles the markdown file here into a pretty presentation and the PDF also found in this repository.
