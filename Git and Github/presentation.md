# Have you ever...
1. Messed up really bad and wished you had a giant "undo" button
2. Been worried about what will happen to your code if your computer crashes
3. Attempted to work on a project with someone else, but not known how to share code

^
Have you ever been working on a project and wanted to try something really
"out there" but were worried about messing up your project?  Or maybe you have
a bunch of code on your computer that you worked really hard on, but are not sure
what the best way to keep that safe is.  Or maybe you wanted to work on something
with your friend, but realized that sharing code can be pretty hard.  Even if you
haven't been in these positions yourself, you an imagine how they can be real
challenges that get in the way of writing great code.  Version Control can help!

# Version Control
1. Lets you create "checkpoints" that you can revert your project to
2. Allows you to back your code up to a server where it will be safe
3. Makes collaboration easy by allowing multiple people to share a code base

^
In essence, version control allows you to create checkpoints in your app that you
can always rewind to.  It also provides a simple system for storing your code on
a server where you don't have to worry about it.  This remote storage system then
lets other people share your code and add to your project.

# Git and Github
- Git is a program on your computer that tracks changes to your code and allows you to bundle them into packages called `commits`
- Github is a website that will host your code projects and make it really easy to share them with other people
