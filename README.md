## Notes about writing presentations

- For every presentation created, please create a directory within this repository that includes a `Readme.md`.  The Readme should include the name of the presentation, author name, rough date of publication, summary of the information and links to any important resources that you used in your presentation.
- If your presentation is distributed through some means other than a file, (such as a Prezi presentation) please add a folder to this repository anyway.  Make sure to include a link to the presentation to the `Readme.md`
- For any files used in your presentation, try to use open formats as much as possible.  Please use Markdown files for text, since Github can format these nicely. For other documents, use PDF versions when possible. Including the original Word or Powerpoint files is great too, but include a PDF makes them much easier to view and will work on everyone's computers regardless of what playform they use.
