Presentations created by and for the Pitt CSC

## Notes about writing presentations

- For every presentation created, please create a directory within this
  repository that includes a Readme.md.  The Readme should include the name of
  the repository, author name, rough date of publication, summary of the
  information and links to any important resources that you used in your
  presentation.
- If your presentation is distributed through some other means other than a file,
  (such as a Prezi presentation) please add a folder to this repository anyway
